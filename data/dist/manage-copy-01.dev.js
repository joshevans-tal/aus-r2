      "content": "<p>Your insurance is provided by TAL Life Limited (TAL) as the insurer.  It is important that you have read and understood your <a href=\"https://www.australiansuper.com/insuranceguide\">Insurance in your super guide</a> for the cover for which you are applying.</p>\n                <p>TAL requires a personal statement from you and health information (which may follow) to assist it in making a decision on your proposed insurance cover.  All questions must be answered correctly and completely.</p>\n                <p>The information you provide in this application may be accessible by both AustralianSuper and TAL. Both AustralianSuper and TAL will treat your information in confidence - please read your 'Duty to take reasonable care' and how your personal information is treated in the sections below. Finally, you will need to agree to certain declarations before you can submit this application.</p>\n                <p>You must comply with the 'Duty to take reasonable care' as described below.</p>\n                \n                <h3>The duty to take reasonable care</h3>\n                \n                <p>When you apply for insurance, you are treated as if you are applying for cover under an individual consumer insurance contract. A person who applies for cover under a consumer insurance contract has a legal duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to the Insurer before the contract of insurance is entered into.</p>\n                <p>A misrepresentation is a false answer, an answer that is only partially true, or an answer which does not fairly reflect the truth.</p>\n                <p>This duty also applies when extending or making changes to existing insurance, and reinstating insurance.</p>\n                \n                <h3>If you do not meet your duty</h3>\n                \n                <p>If you do not meet your legal duty, this can have serious impacts on your insurance. Under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) there are a number of different remedies that may be available to the Insurer. They are intended to put the Insurer in the position it would have been in if the duty had been met. For example, the Insurer may:</p>\n                \n                <ul>\n                    <li>avoid the cover (treat it as if it never existed);</li>\n                    <li>vary the amount of the cover; or</li>\n                    <li>vary the terms of the cover.</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                <p>Whether the Insurer can exercise one of these remedies depends on a number of factors, including:</p>\n                \n                <ul>\n                    <li>whether reasonable care was taken not to make a misrepresentation. This depends on all of the relevant circumstances;</li>\n                    <li>what the Insurer would have done if the duty had been met \u2013 for example, whether it would have offered cover, and if so, on what terms;</li>\n                    <li>whether the misrepresentation was fraudulent; and</li>\n                    <li>in some cases, how long it has been since the cover started.</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                <p>Before any of these remedies are exercised, the Insurer will explain the reasons for its decision, how to respond and provide further information, and what you can do if you disagree.\n                \n                <h3>Guidance for answering the questions in this form</h3>\n                \n                <p>You are responsible for the information provided to the Insurer. When answering questions, please:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Think carefully about each question before you answer. If you are unsure of the meaning of any question, please ask us before you respond.</li>\n                    <li>Answer every question.</li>\n                    <li>Answer truthfully, accurately and completely. If you are unsure about whether you should include information, please include it.</li>\n                    <li>Review your application carefully before it is submitted. If someone else helped prepare your application (for example, your adviser), please check every answer (and if necessary, make any corrections) before the application is submitted.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>Please note that there may be circumstances where the Insurer later investigates whether the information given to it was true. For example, it may do this when a claim is made.</p>\n                \n                <h3>Changes before your cover starts</h3>\n                \n                <p>Before your cover starts, the Insurer may ask you whether the information that has been given as part of your application for insurance remains accurate or whether there has been a change to any of your circumstances. As any changes might require further assessment or investigation, it could save time if you let us or the Insurer know about any changes when they happen.</p>\n                <h3>If you need help</h3>\n                <p>It\u2019s important that you understand your obligations and the questions that are being asked. Please contact us for help if you have difficulty understanding the process of obtaining insurance or answering any questions.</p>\n                \n                <p>Please also let us know if you\u2019re having difficulty due to a disability, understanding English or for any other reason - we're here to help and can provide additional support.</p>\n                \n                <h3>Privacy</h3>\n                <p>TAL and its related entities are committed to ensuring that your information is handled responsibly in accordance with the Privacy laws, including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles.

This coverage typically includes three main types of insurance products: Death cover, Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) cover, and Income Protection. Each serves a unique purpose, offering protection in different scenarios.</p>\n                            <h4>Death Cover</h4>\n                            <p>Death cover, also known as life insurance, is paid as a lump sum to your beneficiaries if you pass away or are diagnosed with a terminal illness. This financial support can help cover things like living costs, and future needs, providing peace of mind during difficult times.</p>\n                            <h4>Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Cover</h4>\n                            <p>TPD cover offers a lump sum payment if you're seriously disabled and unlikely to work again. This insurance is designed to help cover rehabilitation costs, debt repayments, and future living expenses, ensuring you're financially supported in case of disability.</p>\n                            <h4>Income Protection</h4>\n                            <p>Income protection, or salary continuance insurance, provides a regular income for a specified period if you're unable to work due to illness or injury. This type of cover is aimed at helping you manage your day-to-day expenses until you can return to work, safeguarding your financial stability.<br><br></p>\n                            <p>Depending on your situation, you may have the ability to choose between different Income Protection cover types. Age-based cover, Fixed cover or other Formula based covers which are usually a calculated amount based on your salary.\n                        </section>\n                        <section>\n                            <h3>Understanding Cover Designs:<br>Fixed vs. Age-Based</h3>\n                            <p>There are two main \"cover types\": fixed cover and age-based cover. Each has its advantages and considerations, affecting how your coverage and premiums evolve over time. In some cases, you are able to mix cover types to fit your needs.  </p>\n                            <h4>Fixed Cover</h4>\n                            <p>Fixed cover maintains a constant level of insurance benefit, regardless of changes in your age. While this can provide certainty about the amount of cover you have, the cost of premiums tends to increase as you get older, due to your increased risk.</p>\n                            <h4>Age-Based Cover</h4>\n                            <p>Conversely, age-based cover uses an age-based curve to adjust your benefit amount according to your age \u2013 typically providing maximum cover in your middle years when you are most likely to have a mortgage or other costs. This method aims to balance the cost of premiums over time, potentially reducing the impact on your superannuation balance.<br><br></p>\n                        </section>\n                        <section>\n                            <p>In summary, your insurance products ensure you are covered in different scenarios, whether you pass away, or require assistance with a living benefit. Your Cover Design affects how your premiums and benefits work over time.<br><br></p>\n                            <p>It is important you are familiar with the specifics of your insurance choices.
